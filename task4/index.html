                    We offer payment plans for many domains in our Marketplace. If you purchase a domain on a payment
                    plan, we hold the domain in an Escrow account until it is fully paid off. However our team can
                    assist you with making any changes to the domains (such as Nameserver changes), so that you can
                    start using the domain right away after making your first installment payment.

                    The 'Managed' option is a fully managed service by Squadhelp Branding experts. It includes a formal
                    brief preparation by Squadhelp team and management of your contest. Managed Contests are a great fit
                    for companies that are looking for an "Agency" like experience and they do not want to manage the
                    contest directly.
                    Our branding team has directly managed hundreds of branding projects and has learned several best
                    practices that lead to successful project outcomes. Our team will apply all best practices towards
                    the management of your branding project.
